## Mathematical Formulas and Equations

### QR Code Data Capacity Calculation
```
C = L × (1 - E)                                                    (1)
```
where:
- C = Effective data capacity (bytes)
- L = Total capacity based on version and error correction level
- E = Error correction overhead ratio

### Gas Cost Estimation
```
G_total = G_base + G_storage × S                                   (2)
```
where:
- G_total = Total gas cost
- G_base = Base transaction gas (21,000)
- G_storage = Storage operation gas cost
- S = Number of storage operations

### Encryption Key Strength
```
T = 2^(k-1) / R                                                    (3)
```
where:
- T = Time to break encryption (seconds)
- k = Key length (bits)
- R = Rate of key testing (keys/second)

### IPFS Hash Generation
```
H = SHA-256(Data)                                                  (4)
```
where:
- H = Content hash (46 characters for CIDv0)
- Data = File content

### JWT Token Expiration
```
E_time = I_time + Δt                                              (5)
```
where:
- E_time = Expiration timestamp
- I_time = Issue timestamp
- Δt = Validity duration (default: 24 hours)

### Tourist Registration Validity
```
V = (T_current < T_expiration) ∧ (S_verified = true)              (6)
```
where:
- V = Validity status (boolean)
- T_current = Current timestamp
- T_expiration = Expiration timestamp
- S_verified = Verification status

### Unique ID Collision Probability
```
P_collision = 1 - e^(-n²/2m)                                       (7)
```
where:
- P_collision = Probability of collision
- n = Number of generated IDs
- m = Total possible IDs (62^10 = 839,299,365,868,340,224)

### Rate Limiting Threshold
```
R_allowed = (R_max - R_current) > 0                               (8)
```
where:
- R_allowed = Request permission (boolean)
- R_max = Maximum requests per window (100)
- R_current = Current request count in window
